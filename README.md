# androidLogo
Created an Android Logo with only CSS

This was a little project I completed in a couple hours with the goal of creating the Android character. 
The simplicity of its shapes made this a project that was acheiveable in a single afternoon.
The CSS also includes hover effects to the arms and head.

To see it deployed, visit http://codepen.io/jimmyespinosa/full/QEOyjv/ for the live example.
